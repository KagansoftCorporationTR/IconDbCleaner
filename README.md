# IconDbCleaner

Has your PC ever screamed like: "I'm running so slow, I feel like I have spiderwebs inside!"

IconDbCleaner is a compact and robust utility designed to permanently resolve common corrupted, broken, or outdated icon cache issues encountered in Microsoft Windows operating systems. 
When the system's speed-optimizing Icon Cahce files becomes corrupted, icons may appear incorrectly, load slowly, or vanish completely. IconDbCleaner safely forces the operating system to rebuild this critical database from scratch.

This program is compiled with Visual Studio 2015.

## Key Features

- Permanently resolves issues with corrupted, missing, or slow-loading desktop icons by safely deleting the system's main icon database file.
- Compels the Windows operating system to generate a clean, error-free icon cache after the old database is removed.
- Prevents the frustrating recurrence of icon display errors, leading to a much more stable user interface.
- Features a minimalist interface with a single Start button, eliminating the need for users to manually navigate complex system settings.

## Requirements

- Windows Vista SP2+
- .NET Framework 4.5.2
